- unsigned pointer to branch targed (and LIT?)
- Didn't implement FLATEST
- Didn't return the address of, for FLATEST (and other variables?)
- Pick added, not subtracted (i.e. picked elements above the stack, not in it)
- Pick used next_inst, not value_stack
- Pick didn't take "pop" into account, so off by one
- Didn't check for feof(stdin)/feof(stdout)
- Failed to work out logic of "while (s = putchar(a) == EOF && !feof(stdout))" (needed parentheses around && and assignment)
- Using *(char *)heap++ = ... didn't work
- Different sizes between x86's dict entry and ARM's
- Forgot to change ~.forth_interpreter~ when changed it to 4byte
